# Nian  Chrome Notification Extension

## what is this

a simple chrome extension for nian desktop notification

if you want to follow someone's newest step~ just try it!

## How to use

* click browser action button to add the Nian uid you want to follow
* then just keep relax and wait for the newest step to be shown by the desktop notification way 233

## TODO 

* only the newest step would be shown and just for once..so we maybe need a more complex logic i.e. only the clikced notification would be marked as read, otherwise it will keep on showing every one minutes (.and this is configurable
* UI improvment
